title: Future planning and Phase 3!
---

Right now the second evaluation (mid-term evaluation) is going on. After this, we will move on to French files as soon as the German files are completed. 

By now, I’m totally familiar with how to process each type of file and everything that needs improvement, and how to fix certain issues we face with some files. As we progress into the last phase of the project, things speed up and there will be lots of tasks and other languages to finish up. 

The progress in phase 2 was okay, and almost all the goals for it are completed. The best part was that now I'm able to complete tasks much more quickly than I thought. Even then, I’m a little behind on my progress with respect to where the project should’ve been by now due to the less completed code in Phase 1. So, I expect to do lots of more work to compensate that and keep the project on track in the last phase so that everything is finished on time. 

After finishing all this work, there remains the job of putting everything together into a pipeline and ensure that it all works on the HPC servers. I would be updating all the different language corpora with their respective tools. The first version of the pipeline was already there. I would be updating it, merge all the different types of tools for the pipeline, and place it inside a singularity container if needed (after discussion with the mentors). The tools so far have been tested on a sample per language and it needs to be ensured that they are working on the respective corpus. Then there is bash scripting to make everything run smoothly. Even as I'm writing this, I'm thinking "There's a lot of work to be done. Stop this post and let's go do it!" haha.

Thus, Phase 3 will require careful planning and lots of work, but after all, that’s what GSoC is all about!
